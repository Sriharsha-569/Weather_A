# Jenkins CI Demo Pipeline

This repository contains a simple Jenkins Declarative Pipeline that demonstrates a typical Continuous Integration (CI) workflow.

## Pipeline Stages
1. **Checkout** – Clones a sample GitHub repository  
2. **Build** – Simulates a build process (e.g., compiling code)  
3. **Test** – Simulates running unit tests  
4. **Report** – Simulates generating a test report  
5. **Deploy** – Simulates deployment to a server  

## Purpose
This is a **pipeline script** to show how Jenkins automates a CI workflow.  
It is not a production application but an example for learning purposes.  

## How to Run
- Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins  
- Use this Jenkinsfile OR configure “Pipeline script from SCM” with this repo  
- Run the pipeline → You’ll see all stages executed in order
